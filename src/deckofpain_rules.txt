How to Perform the Deck of Pain

    Assign Exercises: Assign a bodyweight exercise to each of the four suits (e.g., Spades=Pushups, Hearts=Situps, Clubs=Squats, Diamonds=Lunges).
    Card Values: Numbered cards are face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are 10 reps, and Aces are 11 reps.
    Execute: Shuffle the deck and draw one card at a time, performing the reps for that suit's exercise.
    Finish: Continue through the entire deck. 

Common Exercise Assignments

    Clubs: Push-ups
    Spades: Pull-ups or Bodyweight Squats
    Hearts: Hanging Leg Raises or Sit-ups
    Diamonds: Burpees or Lunges 

Variations

    Beginner: Use only half the deck or lower the face card values to 5.
    Advanced: Add Jokers as a 25-rep burpee penalty or a 1-minute plank break.
    Alternative Rules: Some methods use Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13, Ace=14
